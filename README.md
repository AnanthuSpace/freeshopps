## Introduction

The Freeshopps Admin Panel was developed as a task within a 24-hour timeframe. The admin panel currently includes the following screens:

- **User Management**
- **Rating and Review**
- **History**
- **All Bookings**
- **Referral History**

Due to challenges in locating the exact API endpoints and handling authorization for certain data, the API integration is not complete. Once the appropriate APIs are provided, these screens can be easily updated to render dynamic data.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** Ensures usability across different devices.
- **Modern User Interface:** Clean and intuitive layouts for efficient management.
- **Modular Code Structure:** Easily maintainable and extendable codebase.
- **Static Dashboard Screens:** Ready for API integration when available.

##API Integration Challenges

Due to the limited 24-hour timeframe and difficulties in identifying the correct API endpoints and handling authorization, API integration is currently not implemented. Once the proper APIs are provided, the following screens will be updated for dynamic data integration:

- User Management
- Rating and Review
- History
- All Bookings
- Referral History
